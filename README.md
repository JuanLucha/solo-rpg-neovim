[#](#) Solo RPG for Neovim

A Neovim plugin to play Tabletop RPGs in solo mode. This plugin is meant to be used with markdown documents. When one of the commands (the ones ending in "MD") is used, it inserts its result inside markdown block comments.

The Mythic solo rpg system is written by Tana Pidgeon, from [WordMillGames](https://wordmillgames.com/). If you are interested in knowing how to play amazing roleplaying games without the need of a game master, go there and buy her Mythic GM Simulator. This plugin will help you automate the dices and tables but won't teach you how to play. It's not the purpose of the plugin :)
